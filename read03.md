# Reading and Writing Files in Python

## What Is a File?

Before we can go into how to work with files in Python, it’s important to understand what exactly a file is and how modern operating systems handle some of their aspects.

At its core, a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable. In the end, these byte files are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for easier processing by the computer.

Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:

1. Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
2. Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
3. End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file


**File Paths**
When you access a file on an operating system, a file path is required. The file path is a string that represents the location of a file. It’s broken up into three major parts:

1. Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are     separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
2. File Name: the actual name of the file
3. Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type

Here’s a quick example. Let’s say you have a file located within a file structure like this:

```
│
├── path/
|   │
│   ├── to/
│   │   └── cats.gif
│   │
│   └── dog_breeds.txt
|
└── animals.csv


```
Let’s say you wanted to access the cats.gif file, and your current location was in the same folder as path. In order to access the file, you need to go through the path folder and then the to folder, finally arriving at the cats.gif file. The Folder Path is path/to/. The File Name is cats. The File Extension is .gif. So the full path is path/to/cats.gif.

Now let’s say that your current location or current working directory (cwd) is in the to folder of our example folder structure. Instead of referring to the cats.gif by the full path of path/to/cats.gif, the file can be simply referenced by the file name and extension cats.gif.


```

/
│
├── path/
|   │
|   ├── to/  ← Your current working directory (cwd) is here
|   │   └── cats.gif  ← Accessing this file
|   │
|   └── dog_breeds.txt
|
└── animals.csv

```

```

But what about dog_breeds.txt? How would you access that without using the full path? You can use the special characters double-dot (..) to move one directory up. This means that ../dog_breeds.txt will reference the dog_breeds.txt file from the directory of to:

```

```

│
├── path/  ← Referencing this parent folder
|   │
|   ├── to/  ← Current working directory (cwd)
|   │   └── cats.gif
|   │
|   └── dog_breeds.txt  ← Accessing this file
|
└── animals.csv

```
The double-dot (..) can be chained together to traverse multiple directories above the current directory. For example, to access animals.csv from the to folder, you would use ../../animals.csv.
