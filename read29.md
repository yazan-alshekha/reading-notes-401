# Django Custom User Model
Django ships with a built-in User model for authentication, however the official Django documentation highly recommends using a custom user model for new projects. The reason is if you want to make any changes to the User model down the road--for example adding a date of birth field--using a custom user model from the beginning makes this quite easy. But if you do not, updating the default User model in an existing Django project is very, very challenging.

So always use a custom user model for all new Django projects. However the official documentation example is not actually what many Django experts recommend using. There is a far easier yet still powerful approach to starting off new Django projects with a custom user model which I'll demonstrate here.

If you're brand new to user authentication in Django, I recommend first reviewing how to implement a regular login, logout, signup flow in Django which covers the basics in detail.
### Setup
To start, create a new Django project from the command line. We need to do several things:

- create and navigate into a dedicated directory called accounts for our code
- install Django
- make a new Django project called config
- make a new app accounts
- start the local web server
- Here are the commands to run:

```
cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir accounts && cd accounts
$ pipenv install django~=3.1.0
$ pipenv shell
(accounts) $ django-admin.py startproject config .
(accounts) $ python manage.py startapp accounts
(accounts) $ python manage.py runserver

```
Note that we did not run migrate to configure our database. It's important to wait until after we've created our new custom user model before doing so.

## AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser
There are two modern ways to create a custom user model in Django: AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser. In both cases we can subclass them to extend existing functionality however AbstractBaseUser requires much, much more work. Seriously, don't mess with it unless you really know what you're doing. And if you did, you wouldn't be reading this tutorial, would you?

So we'll use AbstractUser which actually subclasses AbstractBaseUser but provides more default configuration.

#### Custom User Model
Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:

- update config/settings.py
- create a new CustomUser model
- create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm
- update the admin

In settings.py we'll add the accounts app and use the AUTH_USER_MODEL config to tell Django to use our new custom user model in place of the built-in User model. We'll call our custom user model CustomUser.

Within INSTALLED_APPS add accounts at the bottom. Then at the bottom of the entire file, add the AUTH_USER_MODEL config.
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'accounts', # new
]
...
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.CustomUser' # new
```
Now update accounts/models.py with a new User model which we'll call CustomUser.

```
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    pass
    # add additional fields in here

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username
 ```
