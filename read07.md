# Python Scope

1. **Global scope:** The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

2. **Local scope:** The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.


Scope came about because early programming languages (like BASIC) only had global names. With this kind of name, any part of the program could modify any variable at any time, so maintaining and debugging large programs could become a real nightmare. To work with global names, you’d need to keep all the code in mind at the same time to know what the value of a given name is at any time. This was an important side-effect of not having scopes.

Some languages like Python use scope to avoid this kind of problem. When you use a language that implements scope, there’s no way for you to access all the variables in a program at all locations in that program. In this case, your ability to access a given name will depend on where you’ve defined that name.

The names in your programs will have the scope of the block of code in which you define them. When you can access the value of a given name from someplace in your code, you’ll say that the name is in scope. If you can’t access the name, then you’ll say that the name is out of scope.

**Names and Scopes in Python**
Since Python is a dynamically-typed language, variables in Python come into existence when you first assign them a value. On the other hand, functions and classes are available after you define them using def or class, respectively. Finally, modules exist after you import them. As a summary, you can create Python names through one of the following operations

All these operations create or, in the case of assignments, update new Python names because all of them assign a name to a variable, constant, function, class, instance, module, or other Python object.

Python uses the location of the name assignment or definition to associate it with a particular scope. In other words, where you assign or define a name in your code determines the scope or visibility of that name.

For example, if you assign a value to a name inside a function, then that name will have a local Python scope. In contrast, if you assign a value to a name outside of all functions—say, at the top level of a module—then that name will have a global Python scope.


**Python Scope vs Namespace**

In Python, the concept of scope is closely related to the concept of the namespace. As you’ve learned so far, a Python scope determines where in your program a name is visible. Python scopes are implemented as dictionaries that map names to objects. These dictionaries are commonly called namespaces. These are the concrete mechanisms that Python uses to store names. They’re stored in a special attribute called .__dict__.

Names at the top level of a module are stored in the module’s namespace. In other words, they’re stored in the module’s .__dict__ attribute. Take a look at the following code:

```

>>> import sys
>>> sys.__dict__.keys()
dict_keys(['__name__', '__doc__', '__package__',..., 'argv', 'ps1', 'ps2'])

```
After you import sys, you can use .keys() to inspect the keys of sys.__dict__. This returns a list with all the names defined at the top level of the module. In this case, you can say that .__dict__ holds the namespace of sys and is a concrete representation of the module scope.
