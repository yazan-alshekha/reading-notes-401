# Cryptography
Cryptography, or the art and science of encrypting sensitive information, was once exclusive to the realms of government, academia, and the military. However, with recent technological advancements, cryptography has begun to permeate all facets of everyday life.

Everything from your smartphone to your banking relies heavily on cryptography to keep your information safe and your livelihood secure.

 

## Cryptography Throughout History:
Every day, sensitive financial records are transmitted between banks, payment processors, and their customers. And whether you realize it or not, all of these records have to be stored at some point in a large database.

Without cryptography, this would be a problem, a very big problem.

If any of these records were stored or transmitted without encryption, it would be open season for hackers and your bank account would quickly dwindle down to $0.

However, the banks know this and have gone through an extensive process to apply advanced encryption methods to keep your information out of the hands of hackers and food on your table.

 

## Understanding Ciphers: The Basis of All Cryptography
Cryptography, at its most fundamental level, requires two steps: encryptionand decryption.

The encryption process uses a cipher in order to encrypt plaintext and turn it into ciphertext. Decryption, on the other hand, applies that same cipher to turn the ciphertext back into plaintext.




## Why Does Cryptography Matter?
With cryptography, a specific key and numerous calculations are required. Even if someone knew the encryption method used, they wouldn’t be able to decrypt the message without the corresponding key, making your information much more secure.

Anybody with a router could intercept your funds and redirect them to their own account. Your work emails discussing sensitive company secrets? You might as well package those up and ship them to your competitors.

Luckily, we do have cryptographic algorithms that actively protect almost all of our personal data.

However, this does not mean that you are completely secure.

You need to look no further than recent attacks on companies like AdultFriendFinder and Anthem Inc. to realize that large corporations do not always implement the necessary systems required to protect your information.

Your personal security is your responsibility, no one else’s.

And the sooner that you can develop a strong understanding of the systems in place, the sooner you will be able to make informed decisions about how you can protect your data.

 

## Types of Cryptography
- Hashing
Hashing is a type of cryptography that changes a message into an unreadable string of text for the purpose of verifying the message’s contents, not hiding the message itself.

This type of cryptography is most commonly used to protect the transmission of software and large files where the publisher of the files or software offers them for download. The reason for this is that, while it is easy to calculate the hash, it is extremely difficult to find an initial input that will provide an exact match for the desired value.

- Symmetric Cryptography
Symmetric Cryptography, likely the most traditional form of cryptography, is also the system with which you are probably most familiar.

This type of cryptography uses a single key to encrypt a message and then decrypt that message upon delivery.

- Asymmetric Cryptography
Asymmetric cryptography (as the name suggests) uses two different keys for encryption and decryption, as opposed to the single key used in symmetric cryptography.

The first key is a public key used to encrypt a message, and the second is a private key which is used to decrypt them. The great part about this system is that only the private key can be used to decrypt encrypted messages sent from a public key.

- Key Exchange Algorithms
Although this particular type of cryptography isn’t particularly applicable for individuals outside of the cyber-security realm, I wanted to briefly mention to ensure you have a full understanding of the different cryptographic algorithms.

A key exchange algorithm, like Diffie-Hellman, is used to safely exchange encryption keys with an unknown party.
